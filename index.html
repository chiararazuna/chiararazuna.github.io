			<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
			<p>
				Hope is the thing with feathers
				That perches in the soul, 
				And sings the tune without the words,
			And never stops at all,

			And sweetest in the gale is heard;
			And sore must be the storm
			That could abash the little bird
			That kept so many warm.

			I've heard it in the chillest land,
			And on the strangest sea;
			Yet, never, in extremity,
			It asked a crumb of me.
			- emily dickinson

			<h1>Hello how is your day?</h1>
			<p>
			Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
			And sorry I could not travel both
			And be one traveler, long I stood
			And looked down one as far as I could
			To where it bent in the undergrowth;

			Then took the other, as just as fair,
			And having perhaps the better claim,
			Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
			Though as for that the passing there
			Had worn them really about the same,

			And both that morning equally lay
			In leaves no step had trodden black.
			Oh, I kept the first for another day!
			Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
			I doubted if I should ever come back.

			I shall be telling this with a sigh
			Somewhere ages and ages hence:
			Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
			I took the one less traveled by,
			And that has made all the difference.
